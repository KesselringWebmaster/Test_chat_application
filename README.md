Chat
=====================
This is  a test chat application.
The initial idea was to create a really simple php chat, however I take a few more steps ahead and added Foundation to cover GUI. For the Ajax I implemented clean JS XmlHttpRequest as I assume that they want to see it.

Application should work with javascript enabled or disabled.
If js is enabled we send each query by ajax request, otherwise using php from submit.
In any case after message is sent page has to reload itself.
